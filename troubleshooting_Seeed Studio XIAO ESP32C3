BootLoader Mode

There are times when we use the wrong program to make XIAO appear to lose ports or not work properly. The specific performance is:

    Connected to computer, but no port number found for XIAO.
    The computer is connected and the port number appears, but the upload program fails.

When you encounter the above two situations, you can try to put XIAO into BootLoader mode, which can solve most of the problems of unrecognized devices and failed uploads. The specific method is:

    Step 1. Press and hold the BOOT button on the XIAO ESP32C6 without releasing it.
    Step 2. Keep the BOOT button pressed and then connect to the computer via the data cable. Release the BOOT button after connecting to the computer.
    Step 3. Upload the Blink program to check the operation of the XIAO ESP32C6.
